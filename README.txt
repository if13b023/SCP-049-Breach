***WIP***

SCP-049-Breach
=================
This is a university project by Thomas Fischer.

--------
You can find the compiled game executable in the "SCP-049-Breach" folder. 
There is also the matching source code for the binaries.

*Please read the "ReadMe" in that folder before you play this game*

--------
"LightDemo" is just some kind of a sandbox for shadows i have created to create shadows for my game.
--------
"SCP-049_Project" is the actual project - probably unstable!

If you just want to play the game ignore the last two folders!

Questions, suggestions or <put whatever you want in here> -> psychofisch@live.at

sidenote: i know that the source code is horrible and the main function is a bloody mess but it works ;)
